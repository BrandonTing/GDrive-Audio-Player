# GDrive Audio Player Development Plan

## Phase 1: Core Functionality & Setup

1.  **Google API Setup:** I'll start by guiding you to set up a Google Cloud project, enable the Google Drive API, and configure OAuth 2.0 credentials which are necessary for the application to access Google Drive data securely.
2.  **Authentication:** I will implement a "Sign in with Google" button. This will allow the application to request the necessary permissions to read files from your Google Drive.
3.  **File Browsing:** Once authenticated, the application will fetch and display a list of your audio files and folders from Google Drive. I will filter for common audio formats (MP3, WAV, etc.) and create a simple, navigable folder structure.
4.  **Audio Playback:** I will integrate a basic audio player that will allow you to click on any of your audio files to play, pause, and control the volume.

## Phase 2: Playlist Feature

1.  **Playlist UI:** I will create a dedicated section in the UI for your playlist.
2.  **Add to Playlist:** Next to each audio file, I will add an "Add to Playlist" button.
3.  **Playlist Management:** The playlist section will show all added files, and you will be able to reorder or remove them.
4.  **Playlist Controls:** I will add controls to play through the playlist, including "next" and "previous" buttons.

## Phase 3: UI/UX Refinements

1.  **Styling:** I will use a modern CSS framework to give the application a clean and polished look.
2.  **User Feedback:** I will add loading indicators for when the app is fetching data and notifications for actions like adding a file to the playlist.
3.  **Advanced Features:** I will implement a search bar to find files quickly and add shuffle/repeat functionality to the playlist.

## Phase 4: Deployment

1.  **Build:** I will create a production-ready build of the application.
2.  **Hosting:** I will deploy the application to a static web host so you can access it from anywhere.
