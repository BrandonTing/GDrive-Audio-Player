# Current Project Progress Summary

This document summarizes the current state of the GDrive Audio Player project.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality & Setup (Completed)

- **Routing:** A protected routing system is in place.
- **API Integration:** Services are set up to fetch audio files from Google Drive.

## Phase 2: Playlist Implementation (Completed)

- **Playlist State Management:** `playlistMachine.ts` created to manage the playlist.
- **Playlist UI:** `Playlist.tsx` component developed to display and interact with the playlist.
- **Integration:** The `AudioPlayer` is fully integrated with the playlist system.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & UI/UX Polish (In Progress)

- **Advanced Player Controls (Completed):**
    - [x] **Shuffle & Repeat:** Implemented shuffle and repeat (`one`, `all`, `none`) functionality in the `playlistMachine` with corresponding UI controls.
    - [x] **Volume Control:** Added a volume slider to the `AudioPlayer`.
    - [x] **Seek/Progress Bar:** Implemented a seek bar to show and control playback progress.

    - [x] **Loading Indicators:** The UI now shows a loading state while fetching files.
    - [x] **Toast Notifications:** Implemented `react-hot-toast` for "Now Playing" notifications, with the logic centralized inside the `playlistMachine`.
    - [x] **Modern Layout & Styling:** Implemented a modern two-column layout with a fixed audio player using Tailwind CSS. Applied Tailwind classes to `HomePage.tsx`, `AudioPlayer.tsx`, and `Playlist.tsx` for improved visual design and responsiveness.

## Next Steps:

- **Persistence:** Persist the user's playlist and current track to `localStorage` to allow for session resumption.
