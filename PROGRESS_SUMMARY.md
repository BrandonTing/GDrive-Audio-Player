# Current Project Progress Summary

This document summarizes the current state of the GDrive Audio Player project.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality & Setup (Completed)

- **Dependencies:** All core dependencies installed (`@react-oauth/google`, `gapi-script`, `axios`, `react-router-dom`, `xstate`, `@xstate/react`).
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth is fully integrated, with robust state management and context API usage.
- **Routing:** A protected routing system is in place using `react-router-dom` loaders.
- **API Integration:** `axiosInstance` and `googleDriveService` are set up to fetch audio files from Google Drive.
- **Basic Audio Player:** A functional `AudioPlayer` component was created using XState v5.

## Phase 2: Playlist Implementation (Completed)

- **Playlist State Management:** `playlistMachine.ts` created to manage the playlist, including track lists and playback state.
- **Playlist UI:** `Playlist.tsx` component developed to display and interact with the playlist.
- **Context Integration:** `PlaylistContext` implemented to provide global access to the playlist actor.
- **Functionality:** The `AudioPlayer` is fully integrated with the playlist system. Users can select tracks from the playlist, and playback proceeds to the next track automatically.

## Next Steps:

- **Implement Advanced Features & UI/UX Polish:** Begin Phase 3 of the development plan, focusing on enhancing the player with advanced controls and improving the user experience.
