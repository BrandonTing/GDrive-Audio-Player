# Current Project Progress Summary

This document summarizes the current state of the GDrive Audio Player project as of the last interaction.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality & Setup (In Progress)

### Dependencies Installed:
- `@react-oauth/google`
- `gapi-script`
- `axios`
- `react-router-dom`

### Authentication Setup:
- Google OAuth provider integrated into the application.
- `Login` component created with Google Sign-In button.
- Google Client ID is now managed via a `.env` file (prefixed with `PUBLIC_`).
- `.env` file added to `.gitignore` for security.
- Authentication state managed using `useSyncExternalStore` for robust synchronization with `localStorage`.
- `AuthContext` created in `src/context/` to provide `onLoginSuccess` callback via context, removing prop drilling.
- `AuthContext` optimized using `useMemo` for the context value, with `onLoginSuccess` defined directly inside.

### Routing Implemented:
- `react-router-dom` installed and configured.
- `createBrowserRouter` used for router configuration in `src/index.tsx`.
- `RouterProvider` used to render the application.
- Basic routes defined:
    - `/` (protected route, renders `HomePage`)
    - `/login` (public route, renders `LoginPage`)
- `LoginPage.tsx` and `HomePage.tsx` components created in `src/pages/`.
- `GoogleOAuthProvider` moved to `LoginPage.tsx`.
- `protectedLoader` implemented in `src/loaders/` to enforce authentication for protected routes.
- `src/App.tsx` file removed as its functionality is now distributed.

### API Integration Setup:
- `axiosInstance` created in `src/api/` with a request interceptor to automatically attach the Google access token to all outgoing requests.

### Documentation/Guides Created:
- `plan.md`: High-level development plan.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_GUIDE.md`: Step-by-step guide to obtain Google Client ID.
- `ROUTING_PLAN.md`: Detailed plan for routing implementation.
- `REACT_ROUTER_LOADER_GUIDE.md`: Explanation and example of React Router's loader feature.

## Next Steps:

- Begin implementing Google Drive API calls for file browsing.
