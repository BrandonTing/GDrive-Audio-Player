# Current Project Progress Summary

This document summarizes the current state of the GDrive Audio Player project.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality & Setup (Completed)

- **Dependencies:** All core dependencies installed.
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth is fully integrated.
- **Routing:** A protected routing system is in place.
- **API Integration:** Services are set up to fetch audio files from Google Drive.

## Phase 2: Playlist Implementation (Completed)

- **Playlist State Management:** `playlistMachine.ts` created to manage the playlist.
- **Playlist UI:** `Playlist.tsx` component developed to display and interact with the playlist.
- **Integration:** The `AudioPlayer` is fully integrated with the playlist system.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & UI/UX Polish (Completed)

- **Advanced Player Controls (Completed):**
    - [x] **Shuffle & Repeat:** Implemented shuffle and repeat (`one`, `all`, `none`) functionality in the `playlistMachine` with corresponding UI controls.
    - [x] **Volume Control:** Added a volume slider to the `AudioPlayer`.
    - [x] **Seek/Progress Bar:** Implemented a seek bar to show and control playback progress.

- **UI/UX Enhancements (Completed):**
    - [x] **Loading Indicators:** The UI now shows a loading state while fetching files.
    - [x] **Toast Notifications:** Implemented `react-hot-toast` for "Now Playing" notifications, with the logic centralized inside the `playlistMachine`.
    - [x] **Modern Layout & Styling:** Implemented a modern two-column layout with a fixed audio player using Tailwind CSS. Applied Tailwind classes to `HomePage.tsx`, `AudioPlayer.tsx`, and `Playlist.tsx` for improved visual design and responsiveness.
    - [x] **UI/UX Polish:** Improved the overall visual design and layout for a more modern and responsive user experience.

## Phase 4: Testing & Deployment Enhancements (In Progress)

- **Overall Goal:** Develop a GDrive Audio Player application, focusing on robust authentication, improved error handling, and comprehensive testing.
- **Key Knowledge:**
    - The application is a React project using Bun as the package manager.
    - It interacts with the Google Drive API for audio file management.
    - Client-side authentication is handled by `@react-oauth/google`.
    - Deployment is configured for GitHub Pages.
    - Unit testing is set up using Bun's built-in test runner, React Testing Library, and MSW for network mocking.
    - Error handling for 401 responses is implemented in Axios interceptors and React Router loaders, leading to user logout and redirection.
    - Bun's native mocking (`mock()`) is used for unit tests.
    - DOM environment for tests is provided by `@happy-dom/global-registrator` and configured in `bunfig.toml`.
- **Recent Actions:**
    - Successfully implemented GitHub Pages deployment and resolved 404 issues for sub-routes.
    - Established a robust unit testing environment using Bun's test runner, React Testing Library, and MSW.
    - Successfully wrote and passed unit tests for `LoadingSpinner.tsx`, `Login.tsx`, and `googleDriveService.ts`.
    - Resolved multiple configuration and compatibility issues related to Bun's test runner, TypeScript, and mocking libraries.
    - Refined error logging in `googleDriveService.ts`.
- **Current Plan:**
        1. [x] Add unit tests for `axiosInstance.ts` (interceptors).
    2. [x] Add unit tests for `HomePage.loader.ts`.
    3. [x] Set up End-to-End (E2E) testing using Playwright.
