# Application Routing Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing client-side routing in the GDrive Audio Player application.

## 1. Chosen Technology

We will use **`react-router-dom`**, the industry standard for routing in React applications. This will provide a robust single-page application (SPA) experience.

## 2. Implementation Timing

Routing will be implemented immediately after the initial Google OAuth login functionality is confirmed to be working. It is a foundational feature required before building out the file browsing and playlist views.

## 3. The Plan

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   Add the main library: `npm install react-router-dom`
    *   Add TypeScript types for better development experience: `npm install -D @types/react-router-dom`

2.  **Configure the `BrowserRouter`:**
    *   The root of the application (`src/index.tsx`) will be wrapped with the `<BrowserRouter>` component to enable routing throughout the entire app.

3.  **Define Route Structure:**
    *   The main `App.tsx` component will be responsible for defining the application's routes.
    *   The initial routes will be:
        *   `/login`: A public route that renders the `Login` component.
        *   `/`: The primary, **protected route** that will render the main file browser component.
        *   `/folder/:folderId`: A dynamic, **protected route** for viewing the contents of a specific Drive folder.
        *   `/playlist`: A **protected route** for the playlist view.

4.  **Implement Protected Routes:**
    *   A `ProtectedRoute` component will be created.
    *   This component will check for the presence of a valid user session (e.g., an access token in state or local storage).
    *   If the user is authenticated, the `ProtectedRoute` will render the requested component (e.g., the file browser).
    *   If the user is not authenticated, they will be automatically redirected to the `/login` page, securing the application.

5.  **Create Page-Level Components:**
    *   Dedicated components will be created for each route's view, such as `FileBrowserPage.tsx` and `PlaylistPage.tsx`, to keep the code organized and maintainable.
